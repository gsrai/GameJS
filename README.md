## GameJS

A collection of commonly used objects and functions in my canvas games,
you could call it, if you will, a game framework.

#### To Do:
* Split the objects into separate files
* Use requirejs or browserify, some form of module loading.
* Use testing, needs testing, I shall learn testing!
* Abstract game state e.g. pause menu, game over screen etc.
* Better input handling
* sound support
* Maybe use a proper game engine/framework like phaser.

This project is used for 2D HTML5 canvas games.
